  # DAY 1
  On my first day of induction programme , I first went to Gurudwara where the kirtan and ardas was going to held. i took off my shoes and washed my hands. Then, I covered my head and moved inside the hall. The kirtan and ardas made me feel so good and relaxing.
It made me feel that I didn’t choose this but Waheguru Ji had chosen it for me. So, with a brave heart and strong mind I attended it and came outside the hall after it ended. Then I took the refreshments offered by the college which were really good.  After attending kirtan , I went to the Auditorium. Before entering the auditorium, I got a file bag, which was for all students. In the bag, There was brochure about the college, an invitation letter for me, a pen and a notepad. I took it and went inside the auditorium.
The auditorium was very calm, pleasent and was creatively structured. Then, all teachers and seniors came up there. After it, Our respected Principle sir, Dr. Sehijpal Singh Guru, Our Director sir, NSET S.Inderpal Singh along with our alumna Er.Jiwandeep Singh, PCS officer, came there to greet and interact with all of us. First, Our principal sir came and motivated us to make the best use of this platform. Then, Our director sir introduced us to the legendry and illustrious history of this instituion, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated in the establishment of this instituion.
Then, our one of the alumni, now as a PCS officer, who was the “Guest Of Honor” of that day, illustrated us the imporatnce of “what”, “how” and most imporant “My why”. One of the great question which we all should ask from ourselves at the beginning of anything so that we can properly, carefully, whole heartedly and with a great self-confidence do the task we want to do. he explained us the real meaning of an “ENGINEER” that is creators. As a creator, an engineer creates various things to solve a problem in very quick and creative way.
He also made us feel about how significant is an oppurtunity.
He took out a 500 rupee note and ask all of us that whosever want that note can come forward and take the note with him/her. A boy raised his hand and came forward and took it and rest of us were shocked to see it. Then, sir illustrated that every oppurtunity, whether it is small or large, we should grab it on time. we all should be prepared for any kind of oppurtunity.
Then one more alumna, S.Rajeshwar Singh Sidhu, SSP, Interacted with all of us with his wonderful experiences and stories. He emphasised the imporatnce of how GOD took test of all us and give us reward according to it throughout our life. He make us to feel it and told us to just keep your focus on yourself and keep improving yourself.

# DAY 2
 I went to college. I went to the same Auditorium and took a seat. The program started with Mr. Arvind Dhingra sir, head of the Technical activities, pass out of NIT JAIPUR. He explained about how life is all about changing and growing and how will we all can transform. He said it could be done by “I”, which means by changing our mindset and perspective, we all can change and grow. He said that the best song of the world is our own heartbeat and start this college journey with GNDEC with a “YES” instead of a “NO” and have faith on this institution.
He said that everyone is already good in their respective domains but we should try to be a great one and for that we should invest our time in extra curricular along with the regular curricular. He said, invest your time, instead of wasting it. And, by listening to this from sir, I decided to be a legendry who can be great in anything whether it is academics, sports or any other thing.
Then, sir talked about stage fear and called some of the students to break their fear and convert it into confidence and a skill.
Then, sir introduced us about “ Who is a Member”, there are four types:

After this session, One sir came and breifed us about the college, faculties, student council, scholarship and various more things.
Then came a turning point for me and some of more students like me. Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai, The controller of examination, came to mentor all of us.First, he surveyed about how we all think about examinations in just one or two words. I wrote “ Challenge and Motivation”, i am saying this honestly because by these two words I got strength to overcome the fear of it. His perspective, strategies and vision on examinations was fascinating and inspirational.
After, ending sessiion, he proposed all of us that they are giving a chance to 10 students to get mentored under him and get complete guidence about coding. Without any doubt, I went forward to sir to get this oppurtunity. But more that 50 students wanted to be a part of it. So, sir decided to make Telegram group and I entered the group. Sir gave us a task which was to make portfolio using markdown, which I partially completed at that time but now I have done it. And, by taking this goal, I came home and dedicatedly started doing it. I learned markdown and started making the project but I was unable to make my project live at Github pages. But, I sent a pdf format of my work. Then, my day ended and I was ready for the next day as my first day as classes was going to happen.

# DAY 3
The day began with the same routine and I went to college. Today, students have to attend their classes for the first time. Everyone checked their schedule which was sent it on Whatsapp group earlier. I reached outside the auditorium and went to the stairs side. I reached at first floor and then started finding my classroom. It was a very long corridor. Then, I found the classroom where my first lecture was going to held. The first lectures was taken by our seniors. In rhe lecture, they enlighten us about Chatgpt and Excel. Majorly, the Lecture was on Excel. They teached us variuos things about it, new functions about which I was also not aware earlier. Then after finishing, it they as our friend said that if we got in any trouble related to college or studies, we can contact them, ask them and get a solution from them.
I personely really enjoyed it. Then, I went for my second lecture which was of mathematics, my faourite one.

He, introduced, himself and then ask to tell our names individually. Then, after introductuion process, he started teaching about derivatives. Then, the class got over.
Then, I went to a canteen for lunch. After lunch, there was a breifing class of Rai sir. There he breifed us about how can we upload our file to Github and make a live link of it. I got a very good chance to correct my mistakes. Also, sir mentioned that however my task was not fully completed but my efforts were good enough.
